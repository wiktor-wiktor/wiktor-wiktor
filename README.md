👋 Hi, I’m Wiktor (@wiktor-wiktor). I write code from a beautiful city of ~Wrocław~ Ljubljana.

👀 I’m interested in all of the new, hot & shinny tech that comes from right and left. Be that around JavaScript or AI.

🌱 I’m currently learning even more of TypeScript, React Native and Go

🏗️ I'm currently building three things:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a data warehouse built around Strapi and AWS,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a very cool social App build for Spotify users
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a mapping tool of padestrians flow 

💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate on a project that has good intentions and a useful product.

📫 How to reach me? Best by this email: w... wait, how about linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/wiktor-chojnacki/
